# XML User Interface Library #

Using xuilib you can create the dialog boxes using the XML files. The main features:
  * All controls are the native Windows controls so there no problems with the XP/Vista themes
  * Automatically calculated layout
  * Support standards for control sizes and spaces between controls
  * External localization files in the XML format

Currently xuilib is used to make the user interface for the [True Launch Bar](http://www.truelaunchbar.com).
